     This function executes automatically in post index ( get"AttributeName"Attribute) read about it - check documentation
     Well this is called an Accessor and mutators not like in "Java", they allow you to change the data when it is retrieved from a model and set it in the way
    or format you like to see it in before it gets displayed in the view which is quite useful same as using pipeline in Angular 10 value | date(format)/
